        <p className="FAQBold">WANNA CHILL WITH US?</p>  <br></br>
        Come on in! The milkroom is generally a walk-in restaurant and seating
        is on a first-come, first-serve basis. However, for large parties or for
        large food order we do offer a reservation service. Please contact us to
        make your reservation! <br></br> <br></br>
        <p className="FAQBold">GLUTEN-FREE FRIENDLY?</p> <br></br>
        Yes! We have gluten free pancakes that can be topped with gluten free
        chocolate or fresh fruit. You must inform a member of staff about your
        gluten intolerance. Although we offer gluten free alternatives, The milk
        room is not a gluten-free environment. Due to our menu and our use of
        shared cooking and prep areas, we cannot guarantee that our restaurant
        environment or any menu item will be completely free of gluten.{" "}
        <br></br> <br></br>
        <p className="FAQBold">I’M VEGAN. WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME?</p> <br></br>
        We can make our shakes vegan-friendly! Swap our ice cream to soya ice
        cream and enjoy a delicious milkshake or Ice Cream sundae. We also have
        free from chocolate that can be added to your meal and plenty of fresh
        fruit! <br></br> <br></br>
        <p className="FAQBold">I’VE GOT NUT ALLERGIES. CAN I STILL COME?</p> 
        <br></br>
        Yes! We have a selection of nut-free offerings and take allergies very
        seriously. Although we offer nut free options, The Milk Room is not a
        nut-free environment. Due to our menu and our use of shared cooking and
        prep areas, we cannot guarantee that our restaurant environment or any
        menu item will be completely free of nuts. We have a Full Allergen Chart
        available in store. <br></br> <br></br>

        <p className="FAQBold">DO YOU ACCEPT DOGS?</p> <br></br>We love all
        furry friends but unfortunately due to the shop being small we don’t
        allow dogs inside. However, we do have lots of outside seating where
        dogs can sit and chill with their owners. Just ask a member of the team
        for a water bowl and some complimentary ice cream for your doggie to
        enjoy!<br></br>
