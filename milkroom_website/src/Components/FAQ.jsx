        Yes! We have gluten free pancakes that can be topped with gluten free

        gluten intolerance. Although we offer gluten free alternatives, The Milk
        Room is not a gluten-free environment. Due to our menu and our use of
        shared cooking and prep areas, we cannot guarantee that our restaurant
        environment or any menu item will be completely free of gluten.{" "}
